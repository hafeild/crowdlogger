A quick overview of the scripts; you can find out the usage by executing each
with no parameters, e.g.,

    %> php addWin.php
    ...

Scripts:

    addWin.php
        Takes a registration id and the base name of a pdf file, e.g., a pdf
        Amazon gift card, and adds that filename to the 'drawing' table in
        the database. This will (eventually) be communicated to the user
        and they will be able to redeem the gift card. The gift card should
        be placed in ../include/retrieve/

    draw.php
        Performs a raffle. Takes as input a list of job (i.e., experiment) ids.
        Only users that participated in those experiments are considered. Users
        have a greater chance of winning if they referred other users.

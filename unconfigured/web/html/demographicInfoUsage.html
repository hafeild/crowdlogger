To help us understand the types of people who are using the toolbar, we ask you to provide us with some information about yourself.  
This information will never be connected with any of your searches or
browsing information except on average.  For example, we may know that 60%
of the people are women, but will not have any way of connecting browsing
actions to gender.  In addition, we will never maintain information that
connects you, your name, your IP address, or anything else with either the
browsing behavior or the registration information.

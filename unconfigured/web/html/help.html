<h1>%%PROJECT_NAME%% Help</h1>
This page provides help on a variety of actions that are possible with the %%PROJECT_NAME%% extensions for Firefox and Google Chrome. The topics are outlined
here:

<ul>
    <li><a href="#pausingLogger">Pausing and resuming the logger</a></li>
    <li><a href="#toolsMenu">Understanding the %%PROJECT_NAME%% menu</a></li>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="#register">Register</a></li>
        <li><a href="#referAFriend">Refer a friend</a></li>
        <li><a href="#settings">Settings</a></li>
        <li><a href="#statusPage">Status page</a></li>
        <ul>
    		<!-- <li><a href="#win">Check/redeem winnings</a></li> -->
	    	<li><a href="#viewLog">View search log</a></li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

</ul>

<!--
This page is in compliance with version 1.0.0 of the Privacy Preserving Search
Logger project. Some features described here were not offered in earlier
versions of the extension.

<a name="pausingLogger"></a>
<h1>Pausing the logger</h1>
<p>
By default, the logger will start logging as soon as you install the extension.
To pause the logger, click the "pause" button <span style="white-space:
nowrap;">(<img src="images/pauseLogging.png"/>)</span> on the navigation
bar. When pressed, a menu will pop up. The first entry is another pause button. Click that to pause logging; the icon will change into a
"play" button <span style="white-space: nowrap;">(<img
src="images/startLogging.png"/>)</span>.  You can press this button to start
logging again.
</p>

<a name="toolsMenu"></a>
<h1>Understanding the %%PROJECT_NAME%% menu</h1>
<p>
This section describes the tools available in the %%PROJECT_NAME%% menu. This menu can be accessed by clicking the play or pause button on your navigation bar in Chrome or Firefox.
</p>

<div align="center">
    <img src="images/chrome_menu.png" width="75%"/>
</div>

<p>
In this section, we go through the 
<ul>
    <li><a href="#register">Register</a>,
    <li><a href="#referAFriend">Refer a friend</a>,  
    <li><a href="#settings">Settings</a>, and
    <li><a href="#statusPage">Status page</a>
</ul>
menu items. The pause/start logging button was 
discussed above. The Help menu item will bring you to this page.
</p>

<a name="register"></a>
<h2>Register</h2>
<p>
In order for us to understand the demographics of the study participants, and to
enter you into the periodic Amazon.com gift card raffle, we ask that you
register. If you would like to opt out of (or back into) the raffle, this is where you would do
so. This is also where you can enter the code given to you by whoever 
referred you to %%PROJECT_NAME%%. 
</p>

<p>
While you must enter something for (almost) all of the fields, you can
select "I prefer not to answer" for multiple-choice question or enter "PNA"
(prefer not to answer) in text fields.
</p>

<p>
When you click "Register" at the bottom (this will only be click-able once 
you've responded to all of the questions), the extension will attempt to contact
the registration server. If there is a problem, a pop up box will notify you of
such. If successful, a prompt will appear, asking if you would like to refer a
friend.
</p>

<a name="referAFriend"></a>
<h2>Refer a friend</h2>
<p>
If you click on the "Refer a friend" button in either the menu or the 
post-registration prompt described above, you will see a dialog that supplies you with the code you need to give to the participants 
you refer to this study. It will also give you sample text for an email message to send to your friends.  (The %%PROJECT_NAME%% team's experience is that spam filters are less likely to be triggered if you send the message yourself.)
Your friends should enter this code during their registration. 
Participants will be given a greater chance of winning the periodic Amazon.com 
gift card raffles as they refer more participants.
</p>


<a name="settings"></a>
<h2>Settings</h2>
<p>
To access the settings for the extension, select the "Settings" option. 
One of the settings is your <i>pass phrase</i>.
 A pass phrase is used to 
ensure that, if you use %%PROJECT_NAME%% on multiple computers,  
we encrypt the information we extract from all of your logs the same way. This 
way, information extracted from your various computers will not appear as 
though it came from different users, ensuring that we do not falsely decrypt 
your information. <span style="color: red"><b>It is important that you use the 
same pass phrase across all computers.</b></span> 
</p>

<p>
Another setting concerns experiments. Currently the only option
is whether or not to run experiments automatically when they become available. If you select to have experiments run automatically, experiments will run as soon as they are available without your explicit interaction.
</p>


<a name="statusPage"></a>
<h2>Status Page</h2>
<p>
Clicking the "Status Page" menu item will bring you to the %%PROJECT_NAME%% status page. This page includes several important notifications and tools:
<ul>
    <li>Current notifications, such as:</li>
    <ul>
        <!-- <li>that there are pending study action to run</li> -->
        <li>alerts from study researchers</li>
       <!--  <li>a new version of the consent form</li> -->
        <li>a reminder to set your pass phrase, register, and refer friends</li>
        <!-- <li>that you have won a raffle</li> -->
        <!-- <li>that a new version of the extension is available</li> -->
    </ul>
    <li>New messages</li>
    <!-- <li>A list of raffles you have won</li> -->
    <li>A list of studies you have signed up for</li>
    <li>Tools, such as:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>visualizations over your search history</li>
        <li>exporting your search history</li>
        <li>removing individual records from your search history</li>
        <li>removing your local search log from you computer</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
</p>

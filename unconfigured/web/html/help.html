versions of the extension.

<a name="pausing-logger"></a>
<h2>Pausing the logger</h2>
<p>
By default, the logger will start logging as soon as you install the extension.
To pause the logger, click the %%PROJECT_NAME%% icon <img src="images/crowdlogger-logo.001.logging.16x16.png"/> on your browser's navigation bar. That will open the menu for the extension; click the "pause" button <img src="images/pauseLogging.png"/> at the top of the menu. When pressed, the pause icon will change to a "play" button <img
src="images/startLogging.png"/> and the %%PROJECT_NAME%% icon on the navigation bar will be grayed out.  You can press "play" button to start
logging again.
</p>

<a name="menu"></a>
<h2>Understanding the %%PROJECT_NAME%% menu</h2>
<p>
This section describes the tools available in the %%PROJECT_NAME%% menu. This menu can be accessed by clicking the %%PROJECT_NAME%% icon <img src="images/crowdlogger-logo.001.logging.16x16.png"/> on the navigation bar in Chrome or Firefox.
</p>

<div align="center">
    <img src="images/menu-dropshadow.png" width="75%"/>
</div>



<p>
The menu consists of four parts:
<ol>
    <li><img src="images/pauseLogging.png"/>/<img src="images/startLogging.png"/> buttons to toggle logging (<a href="#pausing-logger">see above</a>)
    <li>A link to the settings page
    <li>A link to this page
    <li>A link to the status page&mdash;this is the page from which you can access notifications, tools, and install/configure  apps &amp; studies (<a href="#status-page">see below</a>)
</ol>
</p>


<a name="notifications"></a>
<h2>Notifications</h2>
<p>
Every now and then, you may notice a small orange or red dot on the %%PROJECT_NAME%% icon on your browser's navigation bar: <img src="images/crowdlogger-logo.001.logging.alert-low.16x16.png"/> or <img src="images/crowdlogger-logo.001.logging.alert-high.16x16.png"/>. This indicates that one or more notifications are pending. If you click the icon, the %%PROJECT_NAME%% menu will open and the <a href="#status-page">Status page</a> item will be highlighted. Click the "Status page" menu item to see the notifications.
</p>

<p>
 There are several notifications you may receive, such as:
<ul>
    <li>notices from %%PROJECT_NAME%%, such as when new features or settings are added
    <li>a reminder to update your registration and settings
    <li>notices from study researchers if something needs your attention
</ul>
</p>


<a name="status-page"></a>
<h2>Status Page</h2>
<p>
Clicking the "Status page" menu item will bring up a page that looks something like this:
</p>

<div align="center">
    <img width="75%" src="images/status-page.png"/>
</div>

<p>
This page includes several important pieces:
<ul>
    <li>Current notifications (<a href="#notifications">see above</a>)

    <li>New messages</li>
    <li>Studies and apps you have installed
    <li>Tools, such as:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>visualizations over your search history
        <li>exporting your search history
        <li>removing individual records from your search history
        <li>removing your local search log from you computer
    </ul>
    <li>A link to provide anonymous feedback about CrowdLogger
</ul>
</p>


<a name="tools"></a>
<h2>Tools</h2>
<p>
As listed above, there are several tools available from the Status Page.
In this section, we will briefly describe the following:
<ul>
    <li><a href="#register">Register</a></li>
    <li><a href="#search-histogram">Search histogram</a></li>
    <li><a href="#view-log">View browsing log</a></li>
    <li><a href="#clear-log">Clearing you browsing log</a></li>
    <li><a href="#installing-apps">Installing apps &amp; studies</a></li>
</ul>

<a name="register"></a>
<h3>Register</h3>
<p>
The purpose of registration is for us to collect demographic information about %%PROJECT_NAME%% users. This information is anonymous and is not tied to you or your search data.
</p>

<p>
While you must enter something for all of the fields, you can
select "I prefer not to answer" for any question.
</p>

<p>
When you click "Register" at the bottom (this will only be click-able once 
you've responded to all of the questions), the extension will attempt to contact
the registration server. If there is a problem, a pop up box will notify you of
such. Otherwise, the registration window will close.
</p>


<a name="search-histogram"></a>
<h3>Search histogram</h3>
<p>
You can view your search history&mdash;a list of the searches you have submitted to search 
engines, as well as their frequency&mdash; by selecting the "Search histogram" link under the "Tools" section of the status page. A dialog will pop up listing your searches. You can sort them alphabetically or by frequency by clicking the corresponding header.
</p>




<a name="view-log"></a>
<h3>View search and browsing history</h3>
<p>
You can view your entire browsing history by clicking the "View browsing log"
link on the Status page. As depicted below, the viewer shows the most recent 100 logged events, including
page loads and focuses, searches and link clicks. A summary of each entry is
given and the raw data stored can be viewed by clicking the small <span class="expanders">&#9658;</span> to the
left of an entry.
</p>

<div align="center">
    <img src="images/search-log-viewer.png" width="75%"/>
</div>

<p>
You can move further back or forward in time by clicking the arrow buttons located in the left side of the blue header.
</p>

<p>
You can delete the specifics of an entry by clicking the <span class="delete">&#10008;</span> to the right of an entry. The time stamp, id, and event type will remain in tact.
</p>

<p>
You can export your data in JSON format by clicking the "Save file" button
at the bottom. By default, only the most recent 1,000 events will be saved. 
Entering 'all' (without quotes) in the box and clicking "Save file" will cause
all logged events to be saved. However, this may cause the %%PROJECT_NAME%% 
extension to crash. We are working on a way to make exporting data more stable.
</p>




<a name="clear-log"></a>
<h3>Clearing you browsing log</h3>
<p>
You can completely wipe out your browsing log by clicking "Clear entire log"
on the status page. You have to confirm you want your log removed by clicking 
the red "Confirm delete" button that appears. Once deletion is finalized, 
the word "Cleared" will appear in place of the confirmation button.
</p>



<a name="installing-apps"></a>
<h3>Installing apps &amp; studies</h3>
<p>
Clicking the "Install apps &amp; studies" link on the Status Page will open
the Apps and Studies library, as shown below. You can view all installed and 
available apps and studies from this page. You can install new apps or open, 
configure, disable, or remove already installed ones. Installed apps and studies
are denoted by a ribbon in the upper right corner of their icons. Enabled
apps/studies will have an orange ribbon while disabled ones will have a maroon
ribbon.
<p/>

<div align="center">
    <img src="images/apps-library.png" width="75%"/>
</div>

<p>
Clicking on an app or study icon will bring up a description of that app/study
and buttons for several options:
</p>
If not installed:
<ul class="spaced">
    <li><button class="cl-button">Install</button> Installs the app or study.
    <li><button class="cl-button">Dismiss</button> Removes the description box (you can also do this by clicking anywhere outside of the box).
</ul>
If installed:
<ul class="spaced">
    <li><button class="cl-button">Open</button> Launches the app or study.
    <li><button class="cl-button">Configure</button> Opens the settings window for the app or study.
    <li><button class="cl-button">Remove</button> Uninstalls the app or study, removing all of its stored data.
    <li><button class="cl-button">Disable</button> Unloads the app or study, so that it is not running (its data remains untouched).
    <li><button class="cl-button">Dismiss</button> Removes the description box (you can also do this by clicking anywhere outside of the box).
</ul>
        



<a name="apps-and-studies"></a>
<h2>What are <i>apps</i> and <i>studies</i>?</h2>
<p>
We currently differentiate between two kinds of CrowdLogger Remote Modules (CLRMs): <i>apps</i> and <i>studies</i>. The differences can be subtle, but the general idea is that:
</p>

<p>
    <span style="color: orange">App:</span>
    User-centric; installed for the purpose of helping users visualize or otherwise leverage their search history.
</p>
<p>
    <span style="color: orange">Study:</span>
    Researcher-centric; created as a means for researchers to collect information from users, e.g.: collecting search patterns or asking users to annotate data.

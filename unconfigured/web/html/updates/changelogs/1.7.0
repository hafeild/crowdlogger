    <li>No more desktop notifications! We've added icon notifications: the play
    and pause button icon on the toolbar will display a small colored dot when
    there are pending notifications.</li>

    <li>Automatic refer-a-friend invites! Now Crowdlogger takes care of sending
    emails&mdash;all you've got to do is specify the email addresses. See the
    "Refer-a-friend" page for details.</li>

    <li>The search log stored by CrowdLogger can now be exported as a
    tab-separated-values file.</li>

    <li>The patterns to remove sensitive numbers from searches and urls (e.g.,
    SSN and phone numbers) have been made more restrictive as they were
    blocking too many numbers that were not in fact sensitive.</li>

    <li>Fixed an issue with experiment notifications being displayed while
    experiments were running.</li>

    <li>Running experiments display their progress on the status page.</li>

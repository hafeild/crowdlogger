crowdlogger/web/

The subdirectories are as follows:

    html/
        These are the html and php files that should be publicly available.
        E.g., you could stick these in /var/www/html/.

    scripts/
        Scripts to help out with things.
        

    include/
        Contains the php scripts that list secret things, like the MySQL
        password and db/table names. This should *NOT* be put in a public
        space. Ideally, it should be owned by a dummy apache user, but
        placed outside of where it can be directly viewed.


One thing you might do is copy this web/ directory to /var/www/, so you'd get
a directory structure like:

    /var/www/
        html/ 
        include/
        scripts/


Make sure that you see ../setup/db_create.mysql to see how to create the
database.

    <h1>Getting started</h1>
    <span id="new_install">

    Welcome and congratulations! You have successfully installed the newest
version of %%PROJECT_NAME%%. There are a few more things we
need for you to get started using the logger. This wizard will take you
through those steps.

    <p></p>

    The steps include, among other things, giving consent to participate in our study, registering, and setting some initial preferences. If this is an upgrade as opposed to a fresh install, some of these steps may be skipped, such as showing you the consent form.

    <p></p>
    </span>

    <span id="update" class="hidden">
    Thank you for upgrading to the latest version of %%PROJECT_NAME%%. We would like to take this opportunity to have you update your registration and preferences. If there is a new version of the consent form, we ask you take a look at it, as well.
    <p></p>
    </span>

    <h1>Next step</h1>

    To proceed, simply click the "Continue" button above.

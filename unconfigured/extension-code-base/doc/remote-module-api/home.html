Welcome and thanks for visiting the CrowdLogger Remote Module documentation.
First, lets take a minute to define exactly what a <i>remote module</i> is.
This is the name we give to a set of JavaScript/HTML code that a researcher 
writes for use with a specific set of CrowdLogger APIs. 
</p>

<h2>Why use CrowdLogger Remote Modules</h2>
<p> An example serves well here. Say you, as a researcher, would like to
implement a new system for re-ranking search results on a search engine results
page. This system relies on a user profile built up over time from a user's
search and browsing activity. One way to do this is to create an extension for
multiple browsers that takes care of logging a user's activity and modifies any
visited search result pages. You need users to download this extension and use
it for a while before any meaningful personalization can occur. This is time
consuming, expensive, and a huge pain (worrying about implementing on multiple
systems, etc.). </p>

<p>
Another option is to use CrowdLogger, where all of the foundational work has
already been done. You just need to implement two things: generating the profile
and re-ranking results. An intuitive API provided to CrowdLogger Remote Modules
prevents you from having to worry about the particulars of working with Chrome
or Firefox. 
</p>

<h2>Benefits of CrowdLogger Remote Modules</h2>
<p>
CrowdLogger Remote Modules are extremely powerful for a number of reasons:
<ul>
    <li><span class="highlight">abstraction:</span> no need to worry about the particulars of any one browser
    <li><span class="highlight">low overhead:</span> a powerful array of logging and privacy features are already
        in place within CrowdLogger, such as support extracting Google Instant
        queries and allowing for k-anonymous data uploads
    <li><span class="highlight">simplicity:</span> the API includes shortcuts for a number of mundane, but
        sometimes complicated, tasks such as opening a new window for use with
        extension code
</ul>
</p>

The purpose of this documentation is to give you a solid feel for how to

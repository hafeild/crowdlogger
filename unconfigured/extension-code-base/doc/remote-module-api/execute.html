<h1>Using a CrowdLogger Remote Module</h1>

<p> 
<a name="which-crowdlogger"></a>
<h2>Which CrowdLogger</h2>

If you want to program a CLRM for use with a large network of users via,
e.g., the UMass CrowdLogger Project or one you are hosting, then you can <a
href="#execute/published">publish your module</a>. This basically means your
module gets placed on a server and is loaded from there. Note that publishing
within the UMass CrowdLogger Project requires having your module inspected in
much the same way as an app submitted to the Apple App Store or Google Market
Place would be. </p>

<p> If your developing or only need a module for a local clone of CrowdLogger,
then you can also use the <a href="#execute/published">CLRM development or local
mode</a>. Your modules will look exactly the same, but they are stored
locally on your computer rather than a server. </p>

<p>
<a name="development"></a>
<h2>Development/Local Mode</h2>

When just developing or using CrowdLogger in a lab setting, we don't want to
worry about setting up a server&mdash;even a local one. All you need to do 
to use a CLRM in local or development mode is to set the <code>CLRM_LOCAL_DIR</code>
to the path of the directory containing your CLRM&mdash;that's it! 
CrowdLogger will make all CLRMs in that directory available to the user.
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
{
    "CLRM_LOCAL_DIR": "/path/to/dir"
}
</pre>


<p> TODO: discuss how to refresh this, or will CrowdLogger take care of that
automatically? </p>

<p>
<a name="published"></a>
<h2>Published Mode</h2>

To make your CLRM available to a large user base and avoid the need to constantly push out extension updates, you can use the published mode. This involves placing your CLRM's directory in the <tt>web/remote-modules/</tt> directory in the web server.</p>

<p>If you are hosting your own CrowdLogger server, this is easy. However,
if you want to publish your CLRM in the UMass CrowdLogger Network, then you will
need to have it inspected to ensure that your CLRM meets our security and
privacy standards. <a href="http://www.crowdlogger.org">See the CrowdLogger
website for more information</a>.</p>

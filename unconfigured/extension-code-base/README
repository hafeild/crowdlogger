With the exception of js/alert.js, xul/alert.xul, and css/alert.css, which are
minor modifications of those files that are packaged with Mozilla Firefox. Also,
js/sortable.js, which is a product of Stuart Langridge 
(http://www.kryogenix.org/code/browser/sorttable/sorttable.js).

This directory contains several prominent sub-directories:

    doc/
        Documentation for the files in the js/ directory.
        To create the documentation, you need to run JSDoc
        (http://code.google.com/p/jsdoc-toolkit/). I created a
        script to hold the actual command to run it. Assuming the
        jsdoc install dir is stored in $JSDIR,

        java -jar $JSDIR/jsrun.jar $JSDIR/app/run.js -a \
            -t=$JSDOC/tmplates/jsdoc -d=doc -p js

    html/
        Contains HTML files for use with Chrome and Firefox.

    js/
        Contains JavaScript files for use with Chrome and Firefox.

    xul/
        Contains XUL files for use with Firefox.

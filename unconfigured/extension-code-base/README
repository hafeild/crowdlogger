With the exception of js/alert.js, xul/alert.xul, and css/alert.css, which are
minor modifications of those files that are packaged with Mozilla Firefox. Also,
js/sortable.js, which is a product of Stuart Langridge 
(http://www.kryogenix.org/code/browser/sorttable/sorttable.js).

This directory contains several prominent sub-directories:

    doc/
        remote-module-api/
            Documentation for the remote module API. These are in HTML.

        crowdlogger-api/
            Documentation for the files in the js/ directory.
            To create the documentation, you need to run JSDoc
            (http://code.google.com/p/jsdoc-toolkit/). Assuming the
            jsdoc install dir is stored in $JSDIR, run:

            java -jar $JSDIR/jsrun.jar $JSDIR/app/run.js -a \
                -t=$JSDIR/tmplates/jsdoc -d=doc/crowdlogger-api -p js

    html/
        Contains HTML files for use with Chrome and Firefox.

    html-js/
        Contains JavaScript files that correspond directly to the HTML files
        in html/. These scripts would usually go in <script> tags, but Chrome
        no longer allows that as of manifest version 2.

    js/
        Contains JavaScript files for use with Chrome and Firefox.

    xul/
        Contains XUL files for use with Firefox.

# Overview #
CrowdLogger is a platform for collecting user search behavior. Data is stored locally on users' own machines, giving users full control over their data. Researchers can provide apps for search tools/prototypes or research studies, and users can choose which apps to download.  Apps have available to them a rich API allowing them to:

  * access browsing events, historically and in real-time
  * interact with users (e.g., a search tool UI or feedback for a study)
  * upload data privately (optional) and securely
  * access server-side resources
  * inject JavaScript into viewed web pages

Some possible use cases for search tools/prototype apps include:

  * organize a user's search history
  * assist users in search result re-finding
  * highlight new content on pages

Possible research study apps include:

  * collecting user behavior to create user search models
  * asking users to rate the success of their searches to generate search success models
  * collecting relevance judgments

CrowdLogger is currently available as a browser extension for Google Chrome and Firefox.

If you find this code useful or use it in a study, please email me. I'd love to compile a list of folks and projects that have used this.
